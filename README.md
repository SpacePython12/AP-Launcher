# AP-Launcher
A custom Minecraft launcher coded entirely in python. 
This is also particularly meant for schools who have blocked essential files in order to prevent the game from running.

**Requirements:**
* Python 3.7 or higher
* Java 1.8 or higher

Currently, installing this raw package will not create a .minecraft folder, that's coming in a future update.
Also, this program may have some conflicts with launcher_profiles.json and launcher_accounts.json if they aren't formatted correctly.

In the future, I will link some version packages as backups if Minecraft is blocked on your network.
