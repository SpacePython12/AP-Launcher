# AP-Launcher
A custom Minecraft launcher coded entirely in python. 

* I am NOT responsible for any punishments given out by your network administrator for downloading this software.
* This is a passion project, meaning if people download this, they are responsible for their OWN actions.

**Requirements:**
Python 3.7+, if you are running the source code. Python will not be required for full releases.
You may need to install some libraries, including...
`pip install pillow`
`pip install requests`

* Premium accounts are NOT supported.
* Modded clients (including Optifine) are NOT supported.

In the future, I will link some version packages as backups if Minecraft is blocked on your network.

# Changelog:
* Made some cosmetic changes.
* Added an icon for the launcher.
* Minecraft sounds and other assets are now downloaded at the start.
