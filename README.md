# AP-Launcher
A custom Minecraft launcher coded entirely in python. 

* I am NOT responsible for any punishments given out by your network administrator for downloading this software.
* This is a passion project, meaning if people download this, they are responsible for their OWN actions.

**Requirements:**
Python 3.7+, if you are running the source code. Python will not be required for full releases.
You may need to install some libraries, including...
`pip install pillow`
`pip install requests`

* Premium accounts are NOT supported.
* Modded clients (including Optifine) are NOT supported.

# Changelog:
* Restructured the library loading system a bit.
* Now supports older versions.
* Tweaked the version installers, versions that didn't work before work now.

# Installation instructions:

- Download `APLauncher.Installer.exe` from a release and run it.
- The installer will ask you for your username and UUID in 2 prompts.
      - If you have a premium Minecraft account, it is highly advised you enter that account's details, if you want to play in premium mode in the future.
      - You can find an account's UUID [here](https://mcuuid.net/).
      - If you don't have a premium account, you can make up a username and UUID (generate a UUID [here](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/))
- Once the installer has finished, navigate to `C:\\Users\<your user>\.aplauncher` and run `APLauncher.exe`.
- If you want to add a version follow the steps below:
     1. Download the bundled version or ask me for a different version.
     2. Open AP Launcher and navigate to the "Profiles" tab.
     3. Click "Import new version".
     4. Select the zip file you just downloaded.
     5. Restart AP Launcher and select the version you just downloaded.
     6. Click "Play".
     7. You should be able to play Minecraft now!
