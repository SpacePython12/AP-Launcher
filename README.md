# AP-Launcher
A custom Minecraft launcher coded entirely in python. 

* I am NOT responsible for any punishments given out by your network administrator for downloading this software.
* This is a passion project, meaning if people download this, they are responsible for their OWN actions.

**Requirements:**
Python 3.7+, if you are running the source code. Python will not be required for full releases.
You may need to install some libraries, including...
`pip install pillow`
`pip install requests`

* Premium accounts are NOT supported.
* Modded clients (including Optifine) are NOT supported.

In the future, I will link some version packages as backups if Minecraft is blocked on your network.

# Changelog:
* Java is now automatically installed, so no need to install it anymore!
* If `launcher_process` throws an error, it will now be logged!
* Fixed a LOT of bugs.
* AP Launcher now caches the currently logged in account and selected version.
* Fixed the installer, the last one was super broken.
* I will update this README if I find any more features I added... seriously, I added a lot.
