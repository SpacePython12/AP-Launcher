# AP-Launcher
A custom Minecraft launcher coded entirely in python. 
This is also particularly meant for schools who have blocked essential files in order to prevent the game from running.

**Requirements:**
Python 3.7+, if you are running the source code. Python will not be reqired for full releases.
You may need to install some libraries, including...
`pip install pillow`
`pip install requests`

Premium accounts are NOT supported.
Modded clients (including Optifine) are NOT supported.

In the future, I will link some version packages as backups if Minecraft is blocked on your network.

# Changelog:
*Java is now automatically installed, so no need to install it anymore!

*If `launcher_process` throws an error, it will now be logged!

*Fixed a LOT of bugs.

*AP Launcher now caches the currently logged in account and selected version.

*Fixed the installer, the last one was super broken.

*I will update this README if I find any more features I added... seriously, I added a lot.
