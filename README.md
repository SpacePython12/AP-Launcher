# AP-Launcher
A custom Minecraft launcher coded entirely in python.

**Requirements:**
* Python 3.7 or higher
* Java 1.8 or higher

Currently, installing this raw package will not create a .minecraft folder, thats coming in a future update.
Also, this program may have some conflicts with launcher_profiles.json and launcher_accounts.json if they aren't formatted correctly.

In the future, I will link some version packages if Minecraft is blocked.
